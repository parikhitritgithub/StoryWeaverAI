## 📘 Introduction
GenAI Interactive Learning Games is an innovative project that leverages Generative AI to create immersive and adaptive educational experiences. This specific module—AI-Powered Language and Literacy Games—focuses on enhancing creativity, storytelling abilities, and language skills through interactive, narrative-based gameplay. Players co-create stories alongside an AI storyteller that dynamically adapts the storyline based on the user's choices, boosting both engagement and language proficiency.
 
## 🙏 Acknowledgment
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our mentors, faculty, and peers at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Assam Kaziranga University, for their consistent support and guidance.

We would also like to acknowledge Google DeepMind for providing access to the Gemini Large Language Model, which is central to our project.

Special thanks to the open-source and educational AI communities for their continued inspiration and innovation.

## 🎯 Objectives

&nbsp;&#10022; To develop AI-driven storytelling games that improve reading, writing, and listening skills.

&nbsp;&#10022; To enhance creativity and critical thinking through interactive, AI-generated narratives.

&nbsp;&#10022; To integrate multimodal learning using speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies.

&nbsp;&#10022; To deliver personalized learning experiences using adaptive content generation by Gemini.

&nbsp;&#10022; To promote language development in a fun and user-centered environment.

## 🧠 Large Language Model (LLM) Used
&nbsp;&#10022; We use Gemini by Google DeepMind as the core Large Language Model for:

&nbsp;&#10022; Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Interpreting user inputs and story decisions.

&nbsp;&#10022; Natural Language Generation (NLG): Creating coherent and engaging narrative responses.

&nbsp;&#10022; Contextual Adaptation: Adapting storylines based on user history and preferences.

## 🖥️ User Interface
Our user interface is designed to provide a seamless and interactive storytelling experience, accessible to users of all ages.
