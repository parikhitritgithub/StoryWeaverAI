## 📘 Introduction
GenAI Interactive Learning Games is an innovative project that leverages Generative AI to create immersive and adaptive educational experiences. This specific module—AI-Powered Language and Literacy Games—focuses on enhancing creativity, storytelling abilities, and language skills through interactive, narrative-based gameplay. Players co-create stories alongside an AI storyteller that dynamically adapts the storyline based on the user's choices, boosting both engagement and language proficiency.
